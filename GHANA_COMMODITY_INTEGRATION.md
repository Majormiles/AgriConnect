# Ghana Commodity Price API Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive integration of real-time Ghana commodity pricing using the API Ninjas Commodity Price API. The implementation provides live international commodity prices with Ghana-specific adjustments including local market premiums, seasonal variations, and regional factors.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### 1. Service Layer Architecture
- **Commodity Service** (`backend/src/services/commodity.service.js`)
  - Intelligent caching system (15-minute TTL for commodity data, 1-hour for exchange rates)
  - Rate limiting with 950 requests/month limit (buffer under API's 1000 limit)
  - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Request tracking and monitoring
  - Ghana-specific commodity name mapping

### 2. Currency Conversion
- Real-time USD to Ghana Cedi (GHS) exchange rate fetching
- Fallback exchange rate mechanism (11.50 GHS/USD)
- Automatic currency conversion for all commodity prices
- 1-hour caching for exchange rates

### 3. Ghana Market Adjustments
- **Local Market Premium**: 12% added for transportation and handling
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Based on Ghana's agricultural calendar
  - Dry season (Nov-Mar): +8% to +15% price increase
  - Rainy season (Apr-Jun): Mixed adjustments (+5% to -2%)
  - Peak rainy season (Jul-Sep): -5% to -8% (harvest time)
  - Post-harvest (Oct): +2%
- **Regional Factors**: Price variations by Ghana region
  - Greater Accra: +5% (port proximity premium)
  - Northern regions: -5% to -10% (lower transportation costs)
  - Other regions: -4% to +3% variation
